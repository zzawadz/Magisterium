@article{doubleAuction,
    abstract = {{AbstractMost modern \&\#64257;nancial markets use a continuous double auction mechanismto store and match orders and facilitate trading. In this paper we develop amicroscopic dynamical statistical model for the continuous double auctionunder the assumption of IID random order \&\#64258;ow, and analyse it usingsimulation, dimensional analysis, and theoretical tools based on mean \&\#64257;eldapproximations. The model makes testable predictions for basic properties ofmarkets, such as price volatility, the depth of stored supply and demandversus price, the bid--ask spread, the price impact function, and the time andprobability of \&\#64257;lling orders. These predictions are based on properties oforder \&\#64258;ow and the limit order book, such as share volume of market and limitorders, cancellations, typical order size, and tick size. Because thesequantities can all be measured directly there are no free parameters. We showthat the order size, which can be cast as a non-dimensional granularityparameter, is in most cases a more signi\&\#64257;cant determinant of marketbehaviour than tick size. We also provide an explanation for the observedhighly concave nature of the price impact function. On a broader level, thiswork suggests how stochastic models based on zero intelligence agents maybe useful to probe the structure of market institutions. Like the model ofperfect rationality, a stochastic zero intelligence model can be used to makestrong predictions based on a compact set of assumptions, even if theseassumptions are not fully believable.}},
